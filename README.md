#Dear Volunteer, 
 
Thank you very much for offering help. Your time is highly appreciated. We received offers to help from an overwhelming number of people  with extraordinary talents. 

We broke down the original project in smaller parts to make it a bit more easy to manage and get results as fast as possible, therefore the we would like to start with:

# ctm
